<p align="center">Ara Abcarians and Ian Moersen have a bet about GitHub's future.</p>


## The Bet
*On February 18, 2019, GitHub's most recent valuation will be less than $500 million*

Ian ([@i-a-n](https://github.com/i-a-n)) has proposed this. Ara ([@itsmeara](https://github.com/itsmeara)) has accepted.

If GitHub is worth less than $500 million, Ian wins. If it's worth more, Ara wins.

## The Stakes

The winner must take the loser out for a weekend in Las Vegas. This includes transportation, hotel accomodations, and one big dumb fancy dinner.

## The Log

Github's best recent valuations will be posted to this repository semi-regularly, with info including the dollar amount valued and a brief summary of how this number was decided

[Valuations &raquo;](VALUATION.md)

## The banter

Trash talking will ensue in the [issues](https://github.com/top-performers/github-bet/issues) section, as well as on [Gitter](http://gitter.im) chat, room `#top-performers/Lobby`
