Ara Abcarians and Ian Moersen have a bet about GitHub's future. 


##The Bet
*On February 18, 2019, GitHub's most recent valuation will be less than $500 million.*

Ian (@i-a-n) has proposed this. Ara (@itsmeara) has accepted.

If GitHub is worth less than $500 million, Ian wins. If it's worth more, Ara wins.

##The Stakes

The winner must take the loser out for a weekend in Las Vegas. This includes transportation, hotel accomodations, and one big dumb fancy dinner.

##The Log

Github's best recent valuations will be posted to this repository semi-regularly, with info including the dollar amount valued and a brief summary of how this number was decided.
